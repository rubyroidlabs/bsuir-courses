# Expensy

This is a sinatra web application created to keep track of your expenses, by adding:

* Description
* Date
* Amount
* Category

It will show you your total expense amount and by category.

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.
Everything should be set up.

## Contributing Bugfixes or Features

For submitting something back, be it a patch, some documentation, or new feature requires some level of
community interactions.

Committing code is easy:

- Fork the this repository
- Create a local development branch for the bugfix; I recommend naming the branch such that you'll
  recognize its purpose.
- Commit a change, and push your local branch to your github fork
- Send me pull request for your changes to be included

I apologize in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues.
