Why does the Mona Lisa smile? Because she's laughing inside 
at all the garbage that is reported about her.
It is time to tell some home truths about the Leonardo da Vinci
industry. This great artist really deserves better than the media 
circus of pseudoscience and hocus pocus that surrounds his art. 
No genius merits closer attention from today's world than 
Leonardo. His mind, as revealed in his notebooks,
 is a source of endless fascination, 
 just as his few surviving paintings are 
 infinitely enigmatic. 
 But instead of stories or interpretations that enrich our 
 understanding of Leonardo, the world media delights in 
 endless tittle-tattle and nonsense that just makes his 
 art less meaningful, and reduces him to a bearded magus 
 who painted empty icons.
