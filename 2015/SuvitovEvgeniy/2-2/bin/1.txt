Chorus:
What is love 
Oh baby, don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me no more 
Oh, baby don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me no more 

What is love 
Yeah 

Oh, I don't know why you're not there 
I give you my love, but you don't care 
So what is right and what is wrong 
Gimme a sign 

Chorus

Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 

Oh, I don't know, what can I do 
What else can I say, it's up to you 
I know we're one, just me and you 
I can't go on 

Chorus

Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 

What is love, oooh, oooh, oooh 
What is love, oooh, oooh, oooh 

Chorus

I want no other, no other lover 
This is our life, our time 
When we are together, I need you forever 
Is it love 

Chorus 2x
